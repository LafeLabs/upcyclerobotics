This is an open source company. We are a 1 person LLC in Denver, Colorado, designed for horizontal replication globally with zero intellectual property

Upcycle Robotics exists to teach people how Trash Magic can be used to connect people together to build a better world.  Trash Magic is self-replicating media which consumes waste streams as it replicates.   We make media of all kinds from trash of all kinds, and teach other people how to make it. 

We aim to run 2-4 paid events per week for about 10 people to spread the memes of Trash Magic.  These memes can be used to replicate whatever memes the creators we teach want to: art, music, business, politics, religion, philosophy, social networking, labor organizing, mutual aid, science, etc.

Use Trash Magic to spread your memes!

We will teach you how to make a self-replicating web page which replicates your memes and spread it using trash magic.  We will teach you how to connect with other Trash Magic creators and with physical spaces and the communities in those spaces to spread the Trash Magic network and the web pages it represents.  We will replace search and apps with physical hypertext made of trash.

I will teach you how to make a trash magic web page to start. And then how to replicate it and spread it and link it up with other pages.

When people pay to sign up, we connect them via a formal list on here of paid customers who are going to be supported ongoing in their efforts to spread the network.  We aim to make the classes sliding scale with free and discounted classes as well as premium for specific applications as more involved consulting with companies.
